# NZ Debt Feed ðŸ§¾ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿

This repository contains a Python script that generates an RSS feed showing New Zealand's current national debt and the debt per person. The data is fetched and calculated based on parameters from [DebtClock.nz](https://www.debtclock.nz).

## ðŸ”— Live Feed

You can view the live RSS feed here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://taxpayerhero.github.io/debt-feed/debt_feed.xml](https://taxpayerhero.github.io/debt-feed/debt_feed.xml)

This feed updates **hourly** using GitHub Actions.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The script fetches:
  - `initialDebt`, `targetDebt`
  - `startTime`, `endTime`
  - `populationSize`  
  ...from the live JavaScript in [DebtClock.nz](https://www.debtclock.nz)

- It interpolates the current debt based on the time elapsed in the forecast window.

- It generates an RSS feed item like:

  ```
  $190,456,893,141
  ($93,284.25 per person)
  ```

- The RSS file is committed back to the repository and published via GitHub Pages.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Requests** (for HTML fetching)
- **ElementTree** (for generating XML)
- **GitHub Actions** (to automate updates hourly)
- **GitHub Pages** (to host the RSS feed)

---

## ðŸ•’ GitHub Actions Schedule

The feed is updated every hour via `.github/workflows/generate_rss.yml`.

You can also trigger it manually from the **Actions** tab.
